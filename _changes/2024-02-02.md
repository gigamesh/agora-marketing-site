## Features

- Full re-launch of Optimism Agora – with majorly improved reliability and performance.
- Roll out of advanced delegation begins – with eligible users now being able to split their delegate, and allow their delegates to delegate again – unlocking votable supply that would've otherwise gone stale over time.
- Introducing Optimistic proposals. In this proposal tyupe, unless a sufficient number of voters oppose the proposal, it is automatically passed. This reduces governance fatigue for routine items that need governance visibility, not should be uncontroversial.

## Bug fixes & Improvements
- Prevented users from searching for invalid eth addresses
- Fixed an issue with navbar changing position on each page relaod
- Fixed some caching issues causing stale data to be displayed for too long
