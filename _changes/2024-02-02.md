![Advanced delegation](/assets/changelog/2024-01-03.png)

## New release

- Full re-launch of Optimism Agora – with majorly improved reliability and performance.
- Roll out of advanced delegation on Optimism begins – with eligible users now being able to split their delegate, and allow their delegates to delegate again – unlocking votable supply that would've otherwise gone stale over time.
- Introducing Optimistic proposals on Optimism (Yes, quite the mouthful :P). This reduces governance fatigue for routine items that need governance visibility, are not expected to be controversial.

## Bug fixes & Improvements
- Prevented users from searching for invalid eth addresses
- Fixed an issue with navbar changing position on each page reload
- Fixed some caching issues causing stale data to be displayed for too long

## Coming soon
- Development on advanced proposal lifecycle is actively under way, and expected to first launch for the ENS community
