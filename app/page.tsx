            Running our first delegate race with Agora, we were able to offload
            so much of the operational headaches to them. We attracted 3x more
            active delegates in 1 month than we had in the last 3 years. On top
            of this, we were able to increase votable supply by 25% in the
            ecosystem, this is a crucial step in our path towards decentralizing
            Uniswap.
