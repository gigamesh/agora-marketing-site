## About Agora

Agora is a working towards a new paradigm for group collaboration by creating the tools for communities work together onchain. This is not yet-another-productivity-saas. We believe that to enable the next era of collaboration, we need software that can bend current and create new incentives. No amount of removing friction will change how we work together if our reward functions are misaligned.

So to this end, Agora is working tirelessly on the best end-to-end governance platform for crypto protocols â€“ the first instance of at scale onchain collaboration. Leading communities like Optimism, ENS, Uniswap, Nouns, and more rely on Agora to coordinate their community around critical protocol upgrades, ecosystem funding, and steward their ecosystem for the future.

But thatâ€™s not where weâ€™re stop. Our goal is to build deep collaboration tools for people who couldnâ€™t care less about crypto so that one day (soon), your friends back home are using Agora without ever knowing weâ€™re on Ethereum.

## Responsibilities

We're hiring a frontend-leaning fullstack engineer to work with our engineering and product cofounders in driving Agora's application development strategy and implementation. 

## What we are looking for

We are looking for a fullstack developer who has a passion for pushing the boundaries of onchain governance and decentralized, collective creation forward. Weâ€™d love to work with you if...


- You have experience working with real-time applications
- You have experience with React, NextJS, MVC style frameworks, REST, Postgres
- You have a strong work ethic and care about making day by day progress on what youâ€™re building, but can also reserve a part of your brain untethered from the earth â€“ thinking whatâ€™s at the boundary of the possible.
- You are familiar with how applications in crypto interface with protocols. You don't need to be a solidity expert, but you've got a long wallet history and have used and built many dapps.
- You care deeply about craft and quality â€“ you're frustrated that after all these years, most crypto applications are not even close to their peers in web2.
- You are proud and passionate about Open Source. Bonus if youâ€™ve made contributions to projects.
- You love onchain governance like us :)
- You have strong feelings about `.tsx` vs. `.jsx` files ðŸ˜…

## What we offer

- Ownership â€“ both in responsibility and equity. Weâ€™re a small team with high trust and expectations of each other. We want you to own a sizable chunk of of the product and company, and structure our compensation accordingly.
- Competitive benefits â€“ in addition to good health and dental benefits, we trust all employees with a no-limit company card and equal access to our executive assistant to use however they see fit to increase their productivity.
- A strong team â€“ weâ€™re a small team that values experience, character and integrity. Youâ€™ll work with peers you respect, and who respect you.
- A seat at the table â€“ you will come to all off sites, and be part of all strategic discussions. Weâ€™re hiring for a technical leader, and will treat you as such.
- A path to grow â€“Â our goal is to retain all early hires as senior leaders as the company scales. We believe folks with the best expertise and deep context should lead organizations, even if they donâ€™t traditionally self-identify as people managers.
- Remote friendly, but PST or EST timezones preferred.
